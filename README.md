# NFT gamedev dapp made using vanilla js
Most dapps are built using React, but this one is made using plain old javascript, also known as vanilla js.

## Why?
I recently took a great course on [buildspace](https://app.buildspace.so/home) called "Create your own mini turn-based NFT browser game" and while it was great, it focused too much on React. Being more of a Vue person myself, I decided to recreate the interface using plain old javascript, just to show it can be done.

Here's a video of the interface in action:
